# goit-markup-hw-06

This project was developed as part of the GoIT Fullstack Developer curriculum to advance practical skills in HTML and CSS while implementing a structured and responsive static web page for a Web Studio themed layout.

Aligned with current web development fundamentals:

- Semantic HTML5 elements are used to organize the document structure clearly and to support basic accessibility.
- External CSS is utilized to control the visual design, layout composition, and responsive behavior of the interface.
- Page sections include a services overview, team profiles, and contact form elements, designed to reflect typical business web page structure.
- All media assets (images, icons, etc.) are organized in the `images/` directory to ensure maintainability and clarity of the project structure.
- File and folder naming conventions follow widely accepted frontend development practices to support readability and long-term maintainability.

This repository represents the sixth assignment in the GoIT Web Studio module and demonstrates concrete application of semantic markup and stylesheet design principles in a static web context.
